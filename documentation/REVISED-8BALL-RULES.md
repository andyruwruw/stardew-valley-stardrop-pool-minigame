# Stardrop Pool: Revised 8-Ball Rules

The rules are based on [UPA 8-Ball rules](https://upatour.com/8-ball-rules/) with some revisions for the sake of simplicity.

## Object of the Game

The object of 8-ball is to win by legally pocketing the 8-ball.

8-Ball is played with a cue ball and fifteen object balls, numbered 1 through 15. Balls 1–7 are solid colors and commonly referred to as “low balls”, and balls 9–15 are striped and commonly referred to as “high balls.” One player must pocket balls of solid colors, while the other player must pocket the striped balls. The player who pockets their entire group and then legally pockets the 8-ball wins the game.

## How to Rack

The balls are racked in order with the base of the rack is parallel to the short end of the pool table and is positioned so the ball in the tip of the rack is located on the center of the foot spot. Within the rack, the 8-ball is centered.

## Legal Break Shot

A player will be chosen at random to break first.

The breaker must strike at least one ball.

**Foul On Break**:

If the breaker makes a legal break, however, commits a foul, the game is to continue with the opponent having ball in hand anywhere behind the head-string, however must shoot an object ball beyond the head-string (outside of the “kitchen”) or it is a foul.

## Open Table

The table is always open immediately after the break shot. The player’s designated group (solids or stripes) will not be determined until a player legally pockets a called object ball.

The table is considered an “open” table when the choice of groups (solid or stripes) has not yet been determined. When the table is open, it is legal to hit one group of balls in order to pocket another ball from the opposite group.

When any numbered ball is pocketed on a legal break the breaking player is to continue their inning.

Pocketing a legal ball results in a continuation of that players turn. Pocketing an illegal ball results in a scratch.

## Scratch

Pocketing the cue ball is a ball in hand foul. Scratching on the 8-ball is not a loss of game as long as the 8-ball was not pocketed.

## Bad Hit

If the first object ball contacted by the cue ball is not a numbered ball from the shooter’s established group, it is a ball in hand foul.

NOTE: If the shooter has no remaining balls from their group in play, the 8-ball effectively becomes the shooter’s object ball.

## Call Pocket

The shooter is only required to specify the intended pocket when making an attempt to pocket the 8-ball to win the game. Should they pocket the 8-ball in any other pocket, this will result in a loss.
