</p>

## 8-Ball

Players are either *stripes* or *solids*. First to pocket all seven of their balls and finally the 8-ball last wins. The most frequently played and well known pool billiards. [Find more info here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-ball)

## 9-Ball

First to pocket the 9-ball wins. Legal shots must hit the lowest ball first. Starts with less balls than [8-Ball](#8-ball) in a diamond shape. [Find more info here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-ball)

## Goalkeeper

*Stardrop Pool Original (made it up)*. Both players have their own cue balls and designated pockets to protect and to score in, like soccer (football). Balance offence and defense for the most success. The player with the most points when all balls are pocketed wins.

## Chaos

*Stardrop Pool Original (made it up)*. Balls do not obey traditional laws of physics. The first person to grow comfortable with the uncomfortable wins. The game is won by the person with the most balls pocketed.

## 9-Ball Solo

See how many shots it takes for you to get all 9-balls in. No time limit, no opponent, just you and the table.

  Change the table and rules in quite a few ways besides table layout.
</p>

## Shot Clock

Time is not infinite and George needs his Leek delivered yesterday. Just like timed chess, you have a limited amount of time to use throughout the game. Running out of time results in a loss.

## Icey

The table is covered in ice. Balls will slide and bounce more than usual. The first person to adapt to the slippery conditions wins.

## Hungry Pockets

Pockets seem to minorly attract balls. Should make things a bit easier. The first person to take advantage of the hungry pockets wins.

## Bouncy Balls

Balls are made of rubber. They will bounce off of each other and the walls more than usual. The first person to adapt to the bouncy conditions wins.

## Sticky Felt

The felt is sticky. Balls will slow down more than usual. The first person to adapt to the sticky conditions wins.

## Invisible Balls

The balls appear brifly when hit and following each turn. The first person to adapt to the invisible conditions wins.

## Teleporting Balls

Instead of bouncing off the walls the balls will teleport to the other side. The first person to adapt to the teleporting conditions wins.

## Powerups

Add various powerups across the table. If you cue ball touches a powerup, you can use it on your next turn. You can only store two powerups so use them wisely.

# Table Layouts

## Classic

Your classic pool table. Four walls, six pockets, and fierce competition.

## Tug of War

Made for Goalkeeper, two pockets on either side for either opponent. Or just play 8-ball on it.

## Crammed

Four small walls. Chaos and unintentional bounces are bound to happen.

## Single Lane

Single lane features a claustrophobic cooridor which will limit your available shots and force you to go for bank shots.

## Custom Layouts?

Plans to implement custom layouts if it's desired.

# Development

I started this project in 2021 with a lot of passion and time. I really hated going to the bar every Friday night and not being able to play pool. I wanted to bring the fun of pool to Stardew Valley.

Like most of my projects, I started with a lot of ambition and lost steam. Creating this mod I spent a lot of time writing my own framework for physics, text, buttons, and menus.

I'm not very artistic, but the straightforwardness of creating pool sprites made it fun and easy to get started.

It's thanks to a few people that remembered the project and were really excited that I came back to finish it.

I took the time to separate out most of the generic logic for my MinigameFramework for  SDV, and I'm exicted to see what other minigames I can create with it. I'll most likely be publishing a separate mod that can be used by others.

Enjoy!

(I will return to updating WaterBot finally)
